# Hi, I'm Patricio Salazar

I'm a full-stack software developer at Empire Medical.
At work, I use tools like **Laravel**, **Livewire**, **Alpine.js**, **MySQL**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
In my personal work I use **Laravel**, **Inertia**, **React**, and **Tailwind** OR the **PERN** stack depending on the project.

I work on side projects of all kinds. That could be web apps, tiny dev tools, or something totally different. My curiosity has no limits.

- **Languages:** JavaScript, PHP
- **UI & Frontend:** Tailwind, React, Inertia
- **Backend & Frameworks:** Node.js, Express, Laravel, Livewire
- **Database & Tooling:** PostgreSQL, Git/GitHub, Atlassian, Sentry, Slack, Notion

## 🎧 Beyond Code
Outside of code, ~~I’m experimenting with making my own hot sauce 🌶️~~(Update: not anymore. Squirrels ate my pepper plants) and enjoy working with audio (I have an audio engineering degree!). I also love curating playlists that help developers get into the flow. Here, I made these for you:
