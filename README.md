# Hi, I'm Patricio Salazar! üëã

I'm a full-stack software developer at Empire Medical. On-and-off the job, I primarily work with tools like **Laravel**, **Livewire**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

On the side, I work on side projects of all kinds. That could be web apps, tools, creative work, working with audio, writing, or even trying new fitness challenges, or working with my hands on something. My curiosity has no limits.

## üõ† Tech
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React
 - **Full-Stack:** Livewire, Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, PHP, Laravel
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Tooling:** Git/GitHub, Postman, VS Code, Atlassian, Slack, Notion

## üåê Featured Projects

- **[Doubles](https://playdoubles.org/)**: An addictive, number doubling game.

## üéß Beyond Code
Outside of code, ~~I‚Äôm experimenting with making my own hot sauce üå∂Ô∏è~~(Update: not anymore. Squirrels ate my pepper plants) and enjoy working with audio (I have an audio engineering degree!). I also love curating playlists that help developers get into the flow. Here, I made these for you:
